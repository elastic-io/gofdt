The device tree describes the various hardware components on the system, including the CPU, memory, peripherals, etc., as well as their configuration and interconnection methods. It provides a hardware abstraction that allows the same operating system kernel to run on different hardware without having to write specific code for each hardware platform.

The Devicetree Blob (DTB) format is a flat binary encoding of devicetree data. It used to exchange devicetree data between software programs. For example, when booting an operating system, firmware will pass a DTB to the OS kernel.
